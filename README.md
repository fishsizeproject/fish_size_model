This code is supporting a submitted publication

A machine learning based image classification method to estimate fish sizes from images without a specified reference object
by Catarina NS Silva, Justas Dainys, Sean Simmons and Asta Audzijonyte

The code can also be found on this Google Colaboratory notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CIA48l35mdHjRF3jjELWBKHpsDnCs9YE?usp=sharing). The notebook allows to run the code online without having to install the packages. 

The study has been supported from European Regional Development Fund (project No 01.2.2-LMT-K-718-02-0006) under grant agreement with the Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT).
